This project addresses the profitability challenges faced by our airline due to stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market. By analyzing our extensive database, we aim to identify opportunities to increase the occupancy rate, thereby enhancing the average profit earned per seat.
